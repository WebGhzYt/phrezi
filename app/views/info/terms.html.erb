                        <p>For any dispute you have with Phrenzi, you agree to first contact us and attempt
                          to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Phrenzi has not been able to resolve
                          the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or
                          controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of
                          or in connection with or relating to these Terms. Unless you and Phrenzi agree
                          otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each
                          party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees,
                          except that Phrenzi will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and
                          arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is
                          non­frivolous. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of
                          arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other
                          witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                          entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall
